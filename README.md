# Adhan

Adhan is a Rust developed application. It collects the prayer times from www.salahtimes.com/uk and outputs them to the console

## How to use

1. Either:
   1. Clone the repo
   2. Build the binary with `cargo build --release`
      - Optionally use `--profile performance` in place of `--release` for a highly optimised binary
2. Or:
   1. `cargo install --profile performance adhan`
3. Run `adhan` to get the prayer times.
4. Run `adhan --help` to get a list of options
